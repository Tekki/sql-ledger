                   SQL-Ledger ERP
                    Version 2.8


DESCRIPTION:
------------
SQL-Ledger is a double-entry accounting/ERP system written
in perl. It has been tested with PostgreSQL, Apache, Netscape,
Mozilla, Galeon, Explorer, Links, Lynx, Konqueror, Voyager,
W3M and Opera clients on Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, Windows,
Mac computers and PDA's.

Data is stored in a SQL database server, either locally or
remote, the display is through a text or GUI web browser.
The system is linked by a chart of accounts.  All transactions
for AR, AP and GL are stored in a transaction table. Hyper-links
from the chart of accounts let you view transactions posted
through AR, AP and GL.

Configuration files let you specify to which SQL database server
to connect to, personal preferences such as company name,
language, number and date format, etc.

With the admin script you can create, edit or delete users,
create and delete datasets and set up the Chart of Accounts
and templates needed for the system.

You can have a group of users using the same dataset and
templates for generating Invoices, Income Statements and
Balance Sheets or a different set altogether.

Templates are supplied in html, text and tex format to
generate most of the forms. Forms can be printed to screen,
sent to a printer or e-mailed.


LATEST VERSION:
---------------
available from http://www.sql-ledger.com


PLATFORMS:
----------
Non specific, see requirements.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1 - Perl, 5+
2 - http server (Apache, NCSA, httpi, thttpd, ...)
3 - SQL Server (PostgreSQL 7.1+)
4 - DBD (DBD-Pg)
5 - DBI
6 - LaTeX (optional)


FOREIGN LANGUAGE SUPPORT:
-------------------------
30 languages are supported. Language files are
ordinary text files, no special software is
needed to change or add new translations.

Some of the translation files are not 100% complete.
If strings are missing, English is used instead.


INSTALLATION WITH setup.pl:
-----------------------------
Make a directory on your system

  mkdir /usr/local/sql-ledger

Copy setup.pl to /usr/local/sql-ledger

run setup.pl as root and follow the prompts.

  perl setup.pl

Go to the next step, "PREPARE YOUR SQL DATABASE SERVER".

VERY IMPORTANT: setup.pl tries to figure out your system
but it will not succeed if your distribution decided
to "hide" configuration files for your web server in some
other file.

If you cannot use setup.pl because of a proxy or firewall
download the tar.gz file and pass the filename to setup.pl

  perl setup.pl sql-ledger-2.8.0.tar.gz
  

INSTALLATION WITHOUT setup.pl:
--------------------------------
unpack the tar.gz file in /usr/local

  tar xzvf sql-ledger-2.8.0.tar.gz

you should now have everything in /usr/local/sql-ledger

rename sql-ledger.conf.default to sql-ledger.conf

edit sql-ledger.conf

create the file sql-ledger-httpd.conf in the same location
where httpd.conf is and copy the next section into the file

  Alias /sql-ledger /usr/local/sql-ledger/
  <Directory /usr/local/sql-ledger>
    AllowOverride All
    AddHandler cgi-script .pl
    AddDefaultCharset On
    Options ExecCGI Includes FollowSymlinks
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from All
  </Directory>

  <Directory /usr/local/sql-ledger/users>
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from All
  </Directory>

edit httpd.conf and add

  # SQL-Ledger
  Include /config_directory/sql-ledger-httpd.conf

Note: use an absolute or relative path to include
the configuration in your httpd.conf file.

i.e. /etc/httpd/sql-ledger-httpd.conf
     etc/apache2/sql-ledger-httpd.conf
     
restart your web server.


Note: /usr/local/sql-ledger is only a suggested
path, you can install in any directory.

Some versions of Apache 2 use a confd directory for
configuration files. If this is the case copy
sql-ledger-httpd.conf into this directory and leave
httpd.conf as is. Restart Apache.


SET PERMISSION:
---------------
change directory to /usr/local/sql-ledger

# chown -hR nobody:nogroup users templates css spool

replace nobody:nogroup with the web server user and group.
Some systems use apache:apache, www, www-data, ...


FTP INSTALLATION:
-----------------
If you do not have access to the server's configuration
files install SQL-Ledger in userspace by ftp'ing all the
files to your server.

a) untar sql-ledger in your private_html directory
b) turn on script execution for the folder sql-ledger
You can control this with an .htaccess file

  Options +ExecCGI
  DirectoryIndex login.pl

c) protect the users directory with an .htpasswd file

AuthGroupFile /dev/null
AuthName "Unauthorized"
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /home/host.domain/private_html/sql-ledger/users/.htpasswd
require valid-user

d) protect the templates directory with an .htpasswd file

AuthGroupFile /dev/null
AuthName "Templates"
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /home/host.domain/private_html/sql-ledger/templates/.htpasswd
require valid-user

e) set up your PostgreSQL database and the tables.

You will most likely only have access to PostgreSQL with
some other tools like pgadmin.

1) create a database user or use an assigned database user
2) create a blank database or use one which was created for you
3) load your web browser and connect to
http://host.domain.com/private_html/sql-ledger/admin.pl
to create the tables.

There is no password so just hit the Enter key or click
on "Continue".

Select the "Database Administration" link

Host [database host]               Port [      ]
User [database user]           Password [for your database]
Connect to [your database]

click on "Create Dataset"

The next screen is for choosing a Chart of Accounts

Create Dataset [your database]
Multibyte Encoding [                 ]

Select a chart of accounts and click on "Continue".

Your tables will now be created and the chart of accounts
will be loaded.

Go to the next step, "SET UP A USER"


PREPARE YOUR SQL DATABASE SERVER:
---------------------------------

  PostgreSQL:
  -----------
  add one database user with create database privileges
  to manage the datasets and tables for SQL-Ledger
  
  # su postgres
  $ createuser -d sql-ledger
  Shall the new user be allowed to create more new users? (y/n) n
  
  if you use passwords to access postgres use this command
  $ createuser -d -P sql-ledger


SET UP A DATABASE AND TABLES:
-----------------------------
Load your web browser and connect to
http://localhost/sql-ledger/admin.pl

Select the "Database Administration" link,
enter the user you created in the previous step.

The "Create Dataset" link queries the server
for existing datasets and displays them in a
table. Enter a name for the new dataset (use
lowercase letters only!) and select one of the
Chart of Accounts and click on Continue.

You cannot manage any other datasets from this
interface, only the datasets used by SQL-Ledger.

POSTGRESQL: template1 is only used to query
the server, none of the information stored
in template1 is manipulated in any way.
You can connect to any other database you
own, template1 is only a default.


SET UP A USER:
-------------
Load your web browser and connect to
http://localhost/sql-ledger/admin.pl

Click on "Add User". In the Database
section select the driver and enter
the user you used to create the dataset.


LOAD THE PROGRAM:
----------------------------
Load your web browser and connect to
http://localhost/sql-ledger/login.pl


UPGRADING TO A NEWER VERSION:
-----------------------------
1. load admin.pl and lock the system
2. untar the new version over top
3. check the doc directory for specific notes
4. load admin.pl and unlock the system
5. log in

NOTE: datasets are upgraded when you log in for
the first time. During the upgrade process the
dataset is locked so nobody can do any work.
If an error occurs the system will remain locked.
Track down the error, fix it, load admin.pl,
unlock the system and log in again.


INSTALLATION CHECKLIST:
-----------------------
1. untar SQL-Ledger somewhere (i.e /usr/local, /opt)
2. change permission for the users, templates, css and spool directory
3. edit httpd.conf
4. edit sql-ledger.conf
5. add the database user sql-ledger
6. load admin.pl
7. create datasets for companies
8. add users

   In the Database section enter
   
   a) PostgreSQL
   
      Host:     for local connections leave blank
      Dataset:  the dataset created in step 7
      Port:     for local connections leave blank
      User:     sql-ledger
      Password: password for sql-ledger

Windows: You must enter a host in the Host field. You
can use an IP number too if you do not have a hostname.


IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK:
--------------------------
There is a FAQ at http://www.sql-ledger.com/misc/faq.html
