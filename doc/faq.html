<ul>

<p><li><h4><font color=red>Error!</font>

<p>images/[dataset] : Permission denied</h4>

<p>change the permission for the 'image' directory writeable for the webserver

<p><li><h4>perl 5.26 @INC error</h4>
If you get something like this instead of the login screen
<p>
Can't locate bin/mozilla/login.pl in @INC (@INC contains: /usr/local/lib64/perl5 /usr/local/share/perl5 /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5 /usr/share/perl5) at /var/www/html/sql-ledger/login.pl line 119.
<p>
add the code below at the beginning of am.pl and login.pl if you have
symlinks to the other files in the root directory, otherwise add
it to all the scripts in the sql-ledger root directory

<pre>
BEGIN {
    push @INC, '.';
}
</pre>

For some other workarounds see 
<a href=https://metacpan.org/pod/release/XSAWYERX/perl-5.26.0/pod/perldelta.pod#Removal-of-the-current-directory-%28%22.%22%29-from-@INC>https://metacpan.org/pod/release/XSAWYERX/perl-5.26.0/pod/perldelta.pod#Removal-of-the-current-directory-%28%22.%22%29-from-@INC</a>

<p><li><h4>spool and template directory missing</h4>
The latest archives, starting with 3.0.7, do not have a spool and/or templates
directory. Add the directories with web server write privileges in the
sql-ledger directory before calling up admin.pl

<p><li><h4>Apache 2.4 configuration</h4>
<pre>
AddHandler cgi-script .pl

Alias /sql-ledger /usr/local/sql-ledger/
&lt;Directory /usr/local/sql-ledger&gt;
  Options ExecCGI Includes FollowSymlinks
&lt;/Directory&gt;

&lt;Directory /usr/local/sql-ledger/&gt;
  AllowOverride None
  Require all granted
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>

<p><li><h4>preamble.tex : No such file or directory</h4>
templates are provided as is, some templates may have links to other files
which are not included.
The preample.tex file is a separate file which holds
the header information for a template. Find a template with the header,
that is everything up to \begin document, and put the stuff into a file
called preamble.tex or simply cut and paste the header into the file and
remove the <%include preamble.tex%> directive.


<p><li><h4>wrong papersize</h4>
If the papersize for postscript and PDF does not match set the proper
size with texconfig-sys
<pre>
texconfig-sys pdftex paper letter
</pre>


<p><li><h4>Install Notes for Lighttpd</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make sure mod_cgi and mod_alias are in server.modules list
<li>Add sql-ledger directory as an alias, ie:
<p>alias_url = ( "/sql-ledger/" => "/usr/local/sql-ledger/" )
<li>Set up perl as handler for *.pl files.
<p>cgi.assign = ( ".pl" => "/usr/bin/perl" )
<p>Note: server.follow-symlink is on by default in lighttpd.
<li>Deny access to users directory
<p>$HTTP["url"] =~ "/sql-ledger/users" { url.access-deny = ("") }
</ul>


<p><li><h4>PostgreSQL 8.x</h4>
PostgreSQL added a restriction in v8.x that a sequence cannot be dropped
after if it is referenced by a table. However backups created with
SQL-Ledger v2.6.13 and earlier have a DROP SEQUENCE step in the backup
which will fail. To fix this edit the backup before restoring on a 8.x
system.

<p>This typically looks like this:
<pre>
DROP SEQUENCE id ;
CREATE SEQUENCE id START 10579;
--
DROP SEQUENCE invoiceid ;
CREATE SEQUENCE invoiceid START 11096;
--
DROP SEQUENCE orderitemsid ;
CREATE SEQUENCE orderitemsid START 178;
--
DROP SEQUENCE jcitemsid ;
CREATE SEQUENCE jcitemsid START 53;
</pre>

<p>Change it to:
<pre>
SELECT SETVAL('id', 10579);
SELECT SETVAL('invoiceid', 11096);
SELECT SETVAL('orderitemsid', 178);
SELECT SETVAL('jcitemsid', 53);
</pre>


<p><li><h4>PostgreSQL template1</h4>
template1 is a template to build new databases
from. Anything you put into template1 will be copied to a new database.
When you try to create a new dataset, the tables are already created from
template1 and when SQL-Ledger tries to create them you'll get an error that
the tables already exist.


<p><li><h4>PostgreSQL 8.0+ and SQL-Ledger v2.6.3 and older</h4>
To use SQL-Ledger < v2.6.3 with 8.0+ you have to modify the Pg-tables.sql file.
The file is in the sql directory.

<pre>
CREATE TABLE orderitems (
  trans_id int,
  parts_id int,
  description text,
  qty float4,
  sellprice float8,
  discount float4,
  unit varchar(5),
  project_id int,
  reqdate date,
  ship float4,
  serialnumber text,
  id int default nextval('orderitemsid')
) WITH OIDS;

CREATE TABLE inventory (
  warehouse_id int,
  parts_id int,
  trans_id int,
  orderitems_id int,
  qty float4,
  shippingdate date,
  employee_id int
) WITH OIDS;

CREATE TABLE assembly (
  id int,
  parts_id int,
  qty float,
  bom bool,
  adj bool
) WITH OIDS;
</pre>

This change is only required for SQL-Ledger versions 2.6.4 and older!

<p>If you already built a dataset without this change you will get
an error when you try to save a PO or assembly.
<p>"ERROR: column "oid" does not exist"

<p>Drop the tables and rebuild WITH OIDS.


<p><li><h4>Japanese characters</h4>
modify apache so that EUC_JP is the main additional language.
<br>comment out all unrelated languages except, UTF_8 shift jis, EUC_JP
<br>restart apache
<br>Fire up psql and do the encoding as per the table:-
<br>Table 5-2. Postgres Client/Server Character Set Encodings

<p>Server Encoding Available Client Encodings
<br>EUC_JP EUC_JP, SJIS
<br>EUC_TW EUC_TW, BIG5
<br>LATIN2 LATIN2, WIN1250
<br>LATIN5 LATIN5, WIN, ALT
<br>MULE_INTERNAL EUC_JP, SJIS, EUC_KR, EUC_CN, EUC_TW, BIG5, LATIN1 to LATIN5, WIN, ALT, WIN1250

<p>Create the dataset from admin.pl, now the Japanese shows up in multibyte encoding

<p>Now you can write in Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji and English


<p><li><h4>Error posting a check/receipt</h4>
<pre>
DBD::Pg::db do failed: ERROR: syntax error at or near "," at character 114
Error!
INSERT INTO acc_trans (trans_id, chart_id, transdate,amount)
VALUES (13314, , '03-22-2005',1.00 * 1)
ERROR: syntax error at or near "," at character 114 </pre>
This error is caused by a transaction which does not have links to
an AR/AP account.
<br>There must be at least on AR and AP account.
Then edit all your transactions and repost.


<p><li><h4>SELinux</h4>
<a href=http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/selinux-faq-fc3/index.html>http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/selinux-faq-fc3/index.html</a>

<p>modify /etc/selinux/conf and set SELINUX=permissive

<p>use audit2allow and add the following to policy.conf,
then run "make reload"

<p>#line 83
<br>allow httpd_sys_script_t port_type:{ tcp_socket udp_socket } { send_msg
recv_msg };
<br>allow httpd_sys_script_t sysctl_kernel_t:dir search;
<br>allow httpd_sys_script_t sysctl_t:dir search;
<br>allow httpd_sys_script_t tmp_t:sock_file write;
<br>allow httpd_sys_script_t httpd_sys_content_t:lnk_file read;
<br>allow httpd_sys_script_t sysctl_kernel_t:file read;
<br>allow httpd_sys_script_t unconfined_t:unix_stream_socket connectto;


<p><li><h4>session timeouts</h4>
If you get frequent timeouts or can't even log in synchronize
the clock with your server. It could also be an issue with the
timeout value set in your preferences. The timeout is calculated in seconds
so if you want to limit this to 10 minutes set the value to 600.


<p><li><h4>lineitems not printing</h4>
Templates edited on a UNIX platform don't work on a DOS platform.
To make them work load the template either with the builtin editor
or a text editor and save. Templates designed on a Windows platform have the
same problem and won't work on a UNIX platform. Once you strip the ^M's
the'll work just fine. This only affects the .tex templates because latex
can't process them properly.


<p><li><h4>UTF-8 character encoding</h4>
Most of the translations are in ISO format. To convert the translations
change directory to locale/cc and convert the files with iconv to UTF-8.
You should also convert the COAs too and make sure you select UTF-8
encoding when you set up a new dataset.


<p><li><h4>characterset problems</h4>
If you have problems displaying the correct characterset try adding
<pre>
  AddDefaultCharset On</pre>
in your httpd.conf file.

<p><li><h4>About installation</h4>
The easiest is to use the setup.pl script as root.
You don't need to know very much about your system, just login as root,
run 'perl setup.pl' and follow the prompts.
<p>setup.pl does not check for missing software packages and it is your
responsibility to have the required software
installed either from source or from a package.

<p>Requirements are clearly indicated in the README file and on the
download page.


<p><li><h4>cannot create function</h4>
<ul>
<li>either run createlang and install the plpgsql language handler or
install yourself. For more information how to do that, visit
<a href=http://www.postgresql.org/docs/>PostgreSQL</a> and
read the interactive documentation for procedural languages.

<li>load admin.pl
<li>unlock the system
<li>login
</ul>


<p><li><h4>The requested URL /sql-ledger/admin.pl was not found</h4>
Your webserver doesn't know where to find the script. Most commonly this
is from distributions hiding webserver configuration files in different
locations or files and setup.pl wasn't able to configure the location for
you. Find out which file (httpd.conf, httpdcommon.conf, ...)
controls your webserver configuration and add
<pre>
  # SQL-Ledger
  Include /etc/httpd/sql-ledger-httpd.conf</pre>

Create a file 'sql-ledger-httpd.conf' in /etc/httpd and copy the next part
into the file.

<pre>
  AddHandler cgi-script .pl
  AddDefaultCharset On
  Alias /sql-ledger /var/www/sql-ledger/
  &lt;Directory /var/www/sql-ledger&gt;
    Options ExecCGI Includes FollowSymlinks
  &lt;/Directory&gt;

  &lt;Directory /var/www/sql-ledger/users&gt;
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from All
  &lt;/Directory&gt;</pre>
replace '/etc/httpd' and '/var/www' with the appropriate directories.

<p>If you run Apache and configuration files are in a conf.d directory
you don't need to change httpd.conf but simply copy sql-ledger-httpd.conf
into /etc/apache/conf.d and restart apache.


<p><li><h4>users/members : Permission denied</h4>
Your webserver must have write access to the users directory.
If your server runs as user/group 'apache:apache' then set the
users directory to owner/group apache:apache.
<pre>
  # chown -R apache:apache users</pre>


<p><li><h4>Dataset newer than version</h4>
You are trying to use an older version with a dataset which was
created with a newer version.


<p><li><h4>PDF option not working</h4>
Check if you have latex and pdflatex installed.


<p><li><h4>Apache 2.0 "error 500"</h4>
Some of the early versions of Apache 2.0 (< patchlevel 44) had a rewrite engine
which unescaped escaped strings. This created a lot of problems and I worked
around it by escaping strings twice.
If you get a server 500 error 'filename too long' or if collapsed menus
don't expand you may have to adjusted the following code in
SL/Form.pm and change the number (44) on line 84.
<pre>
  # for Apache 2 we escape strings twice
  if (($ENV{SERVER_SIGNATURE} =~ /Apache\/2\.(\d+)\.(\d+)/) && !$beenthere) {
    $str = $self->escape($str, 1) if $1 < 2 && $2 < 44;
  }</pre>


<p><li><h4>IDENT Authentication failed for user "sql-ledger"</h4>
Edit pg_hba.conf and change authentication to

<pre>
  local           all        all           trust</pre>

The file is in the 'data' directory of your postgresql installation.
This is different with every distribution so look for it.
<pre>
  # find / -name 'pg_hba.conf'</pre>

<p>Some people can't read and seem to think 'localhost' is just some
fancy name for a local machine.
'localhost' is a host like any other host on a network.
A 'local' entry in pg_hba.conf will allow local connections ONLY and
not allow host connections. If you then try to connect to 'localhost'
postgres will come back with an authentication error because you tried
to connect to a host.

<p><b>WARNING!</b> DO NOT just put a 'host all all trust' in pg_hba.conf
and leave your computer hooked up to the Internet. It's ok for trusted
internal networks but NOT when you are hooked up to the Internet.


<p><li><h4>DBD-Pg for Mandrake 9.0</h4>
Mandrake did not package a compiled DBD-Pg package again, so install DBD-Pg
from the source package.
Install perl-DBD-Pg-1.01-4mdk.i586.rpm from the 'contrib' area.
(Mandrake / 9.0 / contrib / RPMS)


<p><li><h4>LaTeX error</h4>
If for some reason LaTeX produces an error message check for strange
characters in your account description and parts description
and use \usepackage[latin1]{inputenc} in the preamble.


<p><li><h4>LaTeX templates</h4>
If you don't want to edit tex code by hand,
you could use Lyx, Abiword, or any WYSIWYG editor capable of exporting
latex code.
To do that you must change the tokens for the variables <% and %> to something
like << and >>. % is the comment character in tex. There is also a
pagebreak block which must be commented out.
When you are done with the changes
replace << and >> with <% and %> and uncomment the pagebreak block.

<p>LaTeX is difficult but it also offers a much superior environment
to produce professionally looking forms in postscript and PDF format.
Unfortunately with all that power there is also a steep learning curve.


<p><li><h4>W3M</h4>
pass terminal=mozilla when you start w3m
<pre>
  $ w3m -F http://localhost/sql-ledger/login.pl?terminal=mozilla</pre>

To use without frames
<pre>
  $ w3m http://localhost/sql-ledger/login.pl?terminal=lynx</pre>

<p><li><h4>PDF option disappeared</h4>
Edit sql-ledger.conf and set $latex = 1;
<br>sql-ledger.conf is perl code. If there is a mistake in the file it
will not be loaded and
the internal defaults are used which turn off $latex, hence no PDF option.


<p><li><h4>Installation on Windows (WIN32)</h4>
<ul>
<li>install Apache, perl,
<a href=http://techdocs.postgresql.org/guides/InstallingOnWindows>Postgres</a>
or Oracle, DBI and the appropriate DBD
module
<li>download the latest version of <a href=/cgi-bin/nav.pl?page=source/index.html&title=Download>SQL-Ledger</a>
<li>extract the files to c:\apache\sql-ledger
<li>run 'perl shebang' to change the first line of the scripts. If perl
is not in c:\perl\bin' change '#!c:\\perl\\bin\\perl' to the location where
your perl binary is.
<li>edit c:\apache\conf\httpd.conf and add
<pre>
Alias /sql-ledger "c:/apache/sql-ledger/"
&lt;Directory "c:/apache/sql-ledger"&gt;
  AllowOverride All
  AddHandler cgi-script .pl
  AddDefaultCharset On
  Options +ExecCGI

<li>start Apache
<li>start Postgres|Oracle|DB2
<li>connect to http://localhost/sql-ledger/admin.pl and set up
datasets
<li>connect to http://localhost/sql-ledger/login.pl and login

</ul>

<p><li><h4>What do I enter for the language</h4>
If you use English, nothing, if you want to use a foreign language for
the login screen and admin stuff enter the language code, this is the
directory in the locale directory.


<p><li><h4>Using samba to send printjobs to a printer attached to a Windows XP workstation</h4>
The next part applies to roll your own print filters only. If you use CUPS or
LPRng use this as a guide how printing works.
I use the printer 'Epson' as an example which is
attached to a XP workstation called Raven.

<pre>
/etc/printcap entry on the server which runs lpd
 
epson:Epson\
  :sh:\
  :lp=/dev/null:\
  :sd=/var/spool/output/epson:\
  :if=/usr/libexec/lpr/epson/prnfilter:\

</pre>


<p><li><h4>beginning balances</h4>
Add a GL Journal entry and enter the beginning balance for your accounts.
Beginning balances are the balances from your last balance sheet. If you also
add open invoices to account for COGS for inventory, add the invoices
and make the appropriate adjustments.


<p><li><h4>establish a beginning inventory</h4>
add the parts with a vendor invoice. Use the <b>real cost</b> for the items,
not zero. If you use zero cost then the cost of goods will be zero when you
sell the item.


<p><li><h4>Assemblies</h4>
Assemblies are manufactured goods assembled from parts, services and
assemblies.  Because you do not buy assemblies you 'stock assemblies' by
adding assembled units to your inventory. The quantity for individual parts 
is reduced and the quantity for the assembly increased. To disassemble an
assembly you simply return the parts to inventory by entering a negative
quantity for the number of assemblies to stock.


<p><li><h4>customizing SQL-Ledger</h4>
The <a href=/cgi-bin/nav.pl?page=feature/api.html&title=Application%20Interface>application interface</a>
consists of a global and private interface.


<p><li><h4>DBD-Pg not installed</h4>

Most modern distributions now package DBD-Pg. If it is
not packaged follow this recipe to get it working.

<ul>
  <li>check if you have the header files for PostgreSQL
  <br>$ find / -name 'libpq-fe.h'
  <br>if nothing shows up install the development package for PostgreSQL
  <li>download and untar DBD-Pg
  <li>set the environment variables POSTGRES_LIB and POSTGRES_INCLUDE
  <li>cd to DBD-Pg directory
  <br>as ordinary user
  <br>$ perl Makefile.PL
  <br>$ make
  <br>$ make test
  <br>if all went well su to root
  <br># make install
  <li>remove DBD-Pg
</ul>


<p><li><h4>login.pl has compilation error</h4>

This could be because of a missing configuration file in the users directory

<p>check the permission for the users directory. The directory must be
set writeable for the webserver.


<p><li><h4>script not executing, shows in browser instead</h4>

Add
<pre>
  AddHandler cgi-script .pl</pre>
in your httpd.conf file.


<p><li><h4>unknown terminal!</h4>
the frontend script couldn't figure out which browser you are using
<p>include the terminal variable on the URL
<pre>
  http://localhost/sql-ledger/login.pl?terminal=lynx</pre>
Valid terminal variables are lynx and mozilla


<p><li><h4>permission denied</h4>

Check if your webserver has write permission to write to the following
directories and files therein:
<pre>
  users/
  templates/
  images/
  spool/
  css/

  # chown -hR nobody:nogroup users templates images spool css

  replace nobody:nogroup with the web server user and group.
  Some systems use apache:apache, www, www-data, ...

</pre>


<p><li><h4>permission denied to access tables</h4>
The user you entered in the "Database section" must be a valid
database user who has rights to access the tables.

<p>If the tables are owned by 'joe' and you enter 'mary' as the dba
you might run into this problem if mary doesn't have the rights to
access tables owned by joe.


<p><li><h4>html and graphics files don't show up on screen</h4>

Enable Includes and FollowSymlinks Options in your httpd.conf file
<pre>
  &lt;Directory /usr/local/sql-ledger&gt;
    Options ExecCGI Includes FollowSymlinks
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>


<p><li><h4>switch display to a foreign language</h4>

Load your preferences and select the language.
<br>Language selection is in accordance to 
<a href=http://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/service/main.htm>
ISO 3166-1</a> standards.


<p><li><h4>Text shows in English when I use a foreign language</h4>

This is because the corresponding hash entry is missing.
Add the missing text in the locale/cc/all or locale/cc/missing
file and run 'perl locales.pl' from the command line to rebuild
the individual files.

<br>cc refers to the country code.


<p><li><h4>switch to a foreign language for the login and admin screen</h4>

Edit sql-ledger.conf and enter the code for the $language variable
<pre>
  $language = "de";</pre>

<p>This is a global change and applies to all logins, individual settings
can be changed by setting the language in your Preferences.

<h1>SQL-Ledger security</h1>

<ul>
<li>The security features built into SQL-Ledger provide passwords,
two step authentication and access control.
If you expose your server on the Internet we strongly advise to use your
web server's authentication mechanism as well.

<p>Some other precautions which are out of our control must also be taken.
It matters where you install SL and how you configure your web server and
SQL database server.

<pre>
  Typical setups:
  
  /usr/local/vh/www                   <- DocumentRoot for virtual host
  /usr/local/vh/sql-ledger            <- Alias for sql-ledger
  /usr/local/vh/users                 <- users directory out of reach

<hr width=60% align=left>
  /usr/local/vh/www                   <- DocumentRoot for virtual host
  /usr/local/vh/www/sql-ledger        <- Alias for sql-ledger
  /usr/local/vh/www/sql-ledger/users  <- users configuration files and tmp space

  &lt;Directory /usr/local/vh/www/sql-ledger/users&gt;  <- disable webserver access
    Order Deny,Allow                                 for users directory
    Deny from All
  &lt;/Directory&gt;

</pre>

The location for the users directory can be specified in sql-ledger.conf

<p><li>Set permission for the users and templates directory to 711

<p><li>If you do not want anyone to change the templates with the builtin
editor set the files in templates/directory/ to read only or disable
the menu item to edit the templates.

<p><li>You can set up a read-only environment if you disable the menu items
to add data. i.e 'Add Transaction' if unchecked you will not be able to add
a transaction or repost a transaction. You may look at it but nothing else.

<p><li>There are various settings for audit control and you can disable
reposting entirely or up to a certain date. And with audit trails enabled
you can keep tab of who is doing what.

<p><li>For PostgreSQL you can also set who has access to the server in the file
pg_hba.conf
<br>Authentication crypt does not work because not all SQL servers
accept encrypted passwords.

<p><li>In addition you can secure the tables from unauthorized access by
setting up a different database user and GRANT rights. For instance,
users without DELETE rights will still be able to use the program, change
customers and vendors, add transactions but will not be able to delete or
repost transactions.
<br>To lock all the tables to create a RO system GRANT SELECT rights only.

<p><li>Other security options include a secure shell, your webserver's
authentication system, SSL, encrypted tunnels, ...

</ul>
